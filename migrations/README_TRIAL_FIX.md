# Trial Management Fix

## Problem
The app had a dual trial management system that was causing conflicts:

1. **Custom Trial Logic**: Hardcoded 3-day trial in `subscriptionService.ts` with database expiration checks
2. **RevenueCat Trial Logic**: RevenueCat's built-in trial management system

The custom logic was overriding RevenueCat's trial management, preventing proper auto-renewal and causing trials to expire prematurely.

## Solution
Removed the custom trial logic and let RevenueCat handle trials entirely.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (`fix_trial_management_for_revenuecat.sql`)
- **Updated `get_user_subscription_status()` function**: Removed custom trial expiration logic
- **Updated `get_user_subscription_info()` function**: Removed dependency on `trial_ends_at` field
- **Comments**: Added documentation explaining that RevenueCat handles trial management

### 2. Subscription Service (`subscriptionService.ts`)
- **Deprecated `activateTrial()` method**: Now returns error message directing to use RevenueCat
- **Updated `updateSubscriptionStatus()` method**: Removed `trial_ends_at` parameter handling
- **Removed custom trial logic**: No more hardcoded 3-day trial periods

### 3. RevenueCat Service (`revenueCatService.ts`)
- **Enhanced trial detection**: Added logic to detect trial subscriptions from RevenueCat
- **Updated `updateSubscriptionInSupabase()` method**: Now supports "trial" status
- **Added `isTrialPeriod()` helper**: Detects trial periods based on expiration dates (7 days or less)
- **Improved sync logic**: Properly handles trial status from RevenueCat
- **Fixed expired detection**: Now properly detects cancelled and expired subscriptions
- **Removed aggressive fallback**: No longer treats any entitlement as active pro
- **Better logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging subscription states

### 4. Subscription Hook (`useSubscription.ts`)
- **Deprecated `activateTrial()` method**: Returns error message directing to use RevenueCat

## Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: RevenueCat is now the only system managing trials
2. **Proper Auto-Renewal**: RevenueCat can handle trial-to-paid conversion automatically
3. **No Conflicts**: Eliminates the dual system that was causing issues
4. **Better User Experience**: Trials work as expected with proper expiration and renewal
5. **Improved Expired Detection**: Properly detects cancelled and expired subscriptions
6. **No False Positives**: Removed aggressive fallback logic that treated expired entitlements as active

## Migration Steps
1. Run the database migration: `fix_trial_management_for_revenuecat.sql`
2. Deploy the updated code
3. Test trial functionality with RevenueCat

## Notes
- The `trial_ends_at` column is kept in the database to avoid breaking existing data
- All trial management now goes through RevenueCat's dashboard configuration
- Custom trial logic is deprecated but not removed to prevent breaking existing code
